# Robotics-and-Embedded-Experiments-From-Code-to-Circuits
Welcome to the Robotics and Embedded Experiments repository! This collection contains code and documentation for various mini-projects, experiments, and hands-on explorations in robotics, embedded systems, and IoT. 
Whether you are a hobbyist, student, or developer, youâ€™ll find these projects useful for learning and building new ideas.  Each experiment dives into different sensors, microcontrollers, and technologies, making it a playground to tinker with code and circuits.

# Equipment
Most of these projects will be done using an arduino board and at times a raspberry pi.
Arduino IDE will be important to have!
